# My emacs configuration stuff
I recently decided to try out emacs, it's alright, but I love vim.
So I had to make emacs more like vim, I found out about evil mode,
which btw is very good vim emulaton!

# Installation
Just git clone this repo into `~/.emacs.d`
```
$ git clone --recursive git@github.com:alicela1n/emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d
$ git submodule update --init --recursive # If you forgot to clone with --recursive
```
